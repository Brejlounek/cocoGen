genetic algorithm for factory location problem

Genetic algorithm approach for solving hard combinatorial problem "Capacitated facility location problem". It's slower than using commercial ILP solver like Gurobi, but can solve problems of a very big size (thousand o facilities/customers).

Evolution can be setup by loading input or population in Source.cpp and by changing parameters in Individual.h and Evolution.h.
